# DialogKey
Successor to popular World of Warcraft AddOn "DialogKey"

# Acknowledgement
The original project was made by Foxthorn on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dialogkey) but stopped being maintained after Battle for Azeroth patch Rise of Azshara (8.2.0). While there have been several forks of the original AddOn since, none of them appear to be maintained. This repository was initialized with the latest release code from Foxthorn but has since been heavily modified to support the modern state of the game.

This repository will temporarily utilize a name "DialogKey" but will change in the future as progress is made as features unique to this version are added.

# Features
- NPC interaction using number keys 0-9
- Binding an action key (default: spacebar) will trigger quest acceptance, completion, or the first interaction on any NPC

# TODO
- Allow for number keys 0-9 to select the desired quest reward
- Implement and/or simply action black-lists so keyboard propagation does not stop normal use of other UI elements
- Rebuild addon options in the game client's unified AddOn configuration settings tab
